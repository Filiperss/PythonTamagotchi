# Python Tamagotchi

I made a silly tamagotchi thingy in python. 

## How to use

python3 Game.py

Files are saved as .pet (They are just ascii tho!)

## Wat it do and don't do

You can feed, water, play, and punch your pet

You can't actually play silly games yet, I'll add that next
You can't see your pet... I should add something for that
It would be cool to choose what you feed your pet.

Thaz eet.
